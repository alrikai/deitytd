/*
 * define the attack types here. This will cover pretty much all attacks (meele will just be very short range)
 * this will be broken largely into 2 parts; the logic (i.e. creation, movement updates, collision detection,
 * damage application/on-hit effects, etc) and the graphics (i.e. all particle effects, animations, models, etc).
 *
 * need to define the properties for the attack (would this just be the spawning towers' attribute list + modifiers?)
 * Also, how will we handle the targetting?
 * Will we set a target in the beginning, then see if it hits? Or will we have targetted/homing attacks?
 * Or will we have the attack movement speed be so fast that they will almost always hit?
