/* This should have the player information -- i.e. if, hypothetically it were a multiplayer game, 
 * then the overall game state would consist of some common game state (i.e. the towers that have been
 * built, the mobs present at any given time, etc), and the individual player states (how much $$, 
 * # lives, items in inventory, etc). This should encapsulate that player state
 *
 * Will have to re-write the UI parts to obtain their state information from here -- however, it'll have
 * to be done in a thread-safe manner, as the player information should live primarily in the backend.
 *
 * Maybe I can have it where at each iteration, the frontend gets a snapshot of the current player state,
 * and it uses that player state for that ieration (or, maybe update it every N ms if it's expensive), and
 * I have the backend write to it w/o synchronization (i.e. the backend will read/write w/o synchronization,
 * then at the end of the backend iteration (or every N ms, whichever) it'll make a deep copy of the player
 * state and (with synchronzation) write that state to a shared location (shared w/ the frontend), so that 
 * then on the next frotnend iteration it'll read from the shared location (protected by a mutex) and 
 * use that value for it's front-end tasks, until it reads the updted value the next time. 
 *
 * Also, if there's no change in state... well, we'll have to see how expensive the deep copy is. SHould
 * be pretty cheap though (if the mutex causes performance problems, maybe also have an atomic bool flag
 * for whether to read the value -- backend sets it, frontend reads it (and resets it).
